- add some parameter "k" representing current time to the compiled payoff code.
  This can help to enforce to keep this parameter when compiling payoff code further
  to some general purpose language;
- add loops to payoff language;
- add accumulator;
- check, whether we can have only one payoff language construct
  for loops and accumulators.
